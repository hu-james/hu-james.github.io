I'm a senior at the University of Florida majoring in computer science with a minor in mathematics. My research interests center around improving AI for precision medicine. Currently, some topic areas that I think about include:

1. Decoding etiologies behind complex, polygenic diseases
2. Mechanistically interpretable AI models
3. Generative models for biology

Recently, I interned at the **Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard** through the Broad Summer Research Program, where I investigated interpretable neural network approaches for optimizing pathway-specific polygenic risk scores. Previously, I was an undergraduate research intern at **Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)**, where I helped work on deep learning-based algorithms for data-driven risk stratification. I'm extremely grateful for my mentors Kenneth Westerman (Broad Institute/Harvard Medical School/MGH) and Mihael Cudic (MGH), who were instrumental to my growth as an aspiring scientist.

In the future, I hope to pursue a PhD within AI for computational biology.
